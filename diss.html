<h2> Left Behind: How Politics Shapes Labor-Markets in Latin America </h2>

<p>
My dissertation takes up the challenge of explaining variation in the enforcement of labor protections. In developing countries, firms frequently deny workers key labor rights inscribed in labor codes, such as the right to an eight-hour workday or a safe workplace environment. A crucial question that emerges is What are the conditions that encourage the enforcement of labor protections? Taking up the challenge of answering this question, my dissertation studies the organization and operations of labor enforcement agencies in Latin America. Contrary to the expectation that governments of the left favor a stricter enforcement of labor protections, I show that these governments do not invest more in stronger inspectorates than other parties in government, nor do they conduct more inspections or increase the productivity of inspectors. On the contrary, they are less likely to do either. My dissertation opens the black box of the large “informal safety net” by developing a theory of how parties use regulatory flexibility to garner support from heterogeneous labor constituencies. Turning a blind eye on labor violations (hacer la vista gorda, as is frequently said in Latin America) provides jobs to unskilled workers willing to forego some regulatory benefits cherished by organized labor. I support these arguments by drawing on extensive fieldwork and a combination of natural experiments and detailed administrative data. I also show that unions prefer lax enforcement under particular circumstances, such as when labor inspectors enforce rules that threaten the job stability of union members or their capacity to extract higher wages.

During the fellowship, I will work on a book manuscript on the political conditions that temper the enthusiasm of governments to enforce labor regulations, as well as the electoral ramifications of fragile labor standards around the world. The book's central premise is that actors’ preferences for regulations and the enforcement of such regulations do not always go hand in hand. In the context of weakly progressive welfare states and rampant income inequality, governments with divided constituencies value enforcement flexibility. Tolerance to labor violations provides insurance for unskilled workers (in the form of low-quality employment opportunities), at the cost of large economic distortions. The book will also be geared toward policy practitioners concerned with promoting better employment relations. Many policy initiatives promote social dialogue among representatives of workers, employers, and the government. My research suggests that policy prescriptions should also consider the distributive effects of enforcement for different types of workers, particularly in segmented labor markets; the inclusiveness of unions; the “quality” of union representation; and whether collective bargaining takes place at the firm, industry, or sectoral level.

During the fellowship, I also plan to publish two pieces of my dissertation as stand-alone papers. The first paper builds on two chapters of my dissertation and studies variation in the enforcement of labor protections across Latin America. Does the left, when it is in power, enforce labor-protecting regulations more than other parties in power? And if not, why not? To answer these questions, I use an original cross-national database, with data for 18 Latin American countries, including information about the partisanship of government and the frequency of labor inspections (disaggregated by size and type of the target industry). In addition, I also collected data about labor inspections at the state, local, and firm level in Brazil. My analysis, which features a regression discontinuity design in close mayoral races in Brazil, shows that parties from the left do not subject businesses to more aggressive field enforcement. On the contrary, leftist mayors in Brazil reduce the level of enforcement and re-locate enforcement efforts to large firms with unionized workers. I explain these findings by examining the regulatory preferences of different types of workers (“insiders” and “outsiders”) and the electoral support coalitions of left governments in Brazil. During the fellowship, I will collect biographical data on Brazilian mayors as well as data on collective agreements signed at the municipal level by unions and employers. I expect that the linkages between organized labor and local incumbents and the capacity of unions to represent informal workers will temper the enthusiasm of left parties for enforcement. 

The second paper investigates the electoral consequences of poor labor standards. Better working conditions and workplace safety have often come at the great cost of human lives, with large industrial disasters being followed by governments improving labor standards. Yet weak labor standards remain the norm in most parts of the developing world. What motivates governments to improve labor conditions? A vast number of scholarly studies show that elections provide strong incentives for better governmental performance. Do voters punish incumbent parties when workers die in dust and methane explosions, factory fires and mine disasters? Are leftist incumbents punished more for failing to prevent these events or, on the contrary, do voters give more support to left parties, in search of more interventionism in labor relations? I investigate these questions in Brazil, the country with the third highest number of work-related fatalities in the world. Using monthly data from death certificates issued between 1996-2012, I show that quasi-exogenous shocks on the number of workplace fatalities substantially decrease the incumbent party’s vote share and re-election probability—but only for leftist parties. At the CIPR, I will explore how voters allocate blame between private and state actors, and between parties with different ideological orientation, by looking at voters’ access to media, and the media’s take on workplace accidents. With this aim, I have begun web-scraping data from national newspapers in Brazil and will extend this exercise to local newspapers in the future.

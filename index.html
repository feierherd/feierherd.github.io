I am a PhD candidate in the Political Science Department at <a href="http://www.yale.edu/polticalscience" title="Yale Uiversity">Yale University</a>. From September 2016, I will be a postdoctoral associate in the Political Science Department at <a href="https://polisci.duke.edu/" title="Duke Uiversity">Duke University</a>. My main interest lies at the intersection of comparative politics and political economy, with a focus on labor and social policies (in the context of "weak" states), distributive politics, and political behavior. I am also interested in methods for causal inference in observational and experimental studies. <br />

<br />
In my dissertation, entitled “Left Behind: How Politics Shapes Labor-Markets in Latin America,”  I take up the challenge of explaining variation in labor  enforcement and labor informality across developing countries, with a focus in Latin America. Using insights from insider-outsider economic theories on labor markets, I show that political parties with popular appeal, caught between insiders and outsiders, take a different approach to regulating labor markets. While other parties see informality as a tax avoidance problem or fertile ground for clientelism, the Left sees informality as a political compromise between the wishes of its organized labor base to retain current regulations (which maximize job security for their members) and the employability of outsiders. I also study the electoral effects of large workplace accidents, using insights from issue ownership and retrospective voting theories.

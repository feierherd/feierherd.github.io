<p id="paper1"> <h3> Distributive Politics in Three-Level Systems: Evidence from a  Large Land-Titling Program </h3> 

Central governments often favor their elected district allies in distributive politics. But what happens when there are more than two relevant levels of government – e.g., a central government, the state or provincial government, and a municipality or county? Using an original dataset with information about a major South American land-titling program and a unique two-level regression-discontinuity design in close regional and municipal elections, I show that the central government gave priority to municipalities in which the mayor was an ally of the central administration but the governor was an opponent. The objective was to undermine the electoral standing of governors. I show that the program yielded an increased vote share for the president’s party in both allied- and, more importantly, opposition-held provinces. Taking only the president-governor or president-mayor relationship into account in this setting would lead to biased inferences and misleading conclusions about the central government’s strategy.

<p id="paper2"> <h3> Do the Wealthy Oppose Redistribution? Public Price Shocks and Redistributive Preferences in Buenos Aires </h3> 

We take advantage of a quasi-experiment involving a sharp public utility rate hike in Argentina to study preferences for redistribution among the wealthy. We find that pocketbook considerations were much less important than interpersonal comparisons in shaping these preferences. The mere fact of having one’s rates quintuple did not sour affluent porteños’ on redistribution, but being reminded that they had fared worse than their equally affluent neighbors did. These people were also relatively unmoved by more altruistic versions of interpersonal comparisons: emphasizing the improvement in income distribution in favor of the poor did not shift their preferences much, nor did wealthy people who escaped the price hike evince much sympathy for those whose rates rose. A lesson from our study is that wealthy individuals may be especially resistant to redistributive policies if they suspect that others in their income strata are not equally burdened.

<p id="paper4"> <h3> How Mayors Hurt Their Presidential Ticket: The Curse of Party Brands in Brazil </h3> 
Do mayors help their presidential candidates win elections? To answer this question, I use a regression discontinuity design for Brazil to estimate the causal effect of co-partisan mayors on their presidential ticket. Contrary to conventional wisdom, I show that presidential candidates do not gather more votes in municipalities governed by co-partisans. In fact, some parties suffer a large penalty from local office holding while others suffer no such penalty. I argue that this is the result of two processes: The well-documented underperformance of Brazilian mayors and the variations across parties in the strength of their party labels. Parties that cultivate a brand are more likely to experience electoral spillovers from local office holding because voters use the performance of incumbents to evaluate the party in toto. Consistent with this, I show that poor performance in aligned municipalities hurts the presidential candidates from the Workers’ Party (PT) but not from its main challenger, the Brazilian Party for Social Democracy (PSDB). I show that dissatisfied and leftist voters are the ones who are abandoning the PT.

<p id="paper5"> <h3> One Foot In, One Foot Out: Informality, Enforcement, and the Partisan Left </h3> 
Many countries have rigid labor regulations; yet, de facto protection of workers tends to be strikingly weak. Does the left, when it is in power in developing countries, enforce labor-protecting regulations more than other parties in power? And if not, why not? I argue that, in labor markets divided between insiders and outsiders, the left – representing the interests of insiders – deters the enforcement of labor protections. Weak labor enforcement allows governments of the left to keep labor protections favored by organized labor while maintaining competitiveness in international world-markets. I find support for this argument using both cross-national data on governments’ ideology and enforcement for 18 Latin American countries between 1985 and 2015 and a regression discontinuity design in close mayoral races in Brazil. Using desegregated enforcement and labor-market data, I show that mayors from the Workers’ Party in Brazil reduce the level of enforcement and re-locate enforcement efforts to the benefit of formal workers.

<p id="paper3"> <h3> A Marathon is Not a Sprint: Business Politics and Tax Exemptions in Brazilian Municipalities  </h3> 

This article examines tax exemptions to businesses in the context of intergovernmental political competition in Brazilian municipalities. The “competitive federalism” tradition argues that competition for mobile sources of revenue leads local governments to a “race to the bottom” in taxation and welfare spending. In this line, studies of Brazil and other countries usually portray local governments engaging on a “fiscal war” to attract investments. I instead argue that parties with different programmatic goals and constituencies differ on the types of investments they wish to attract. I use a regression-discontinuity design in local elections to discern different tax exemption strategies. I find that mayors from different parties are equally likely to grant tax exemptions and other policy benefits to businesses. Yet they differ on the tax instruments they use. Mayors from the center-left Workers’ Party are more likely to waive a tax on services, while mayors from the center-right Social Democratic Party are more likely to waive property taxes. Rather than local governments undercutting one another to attract investments, this article supports a more nuanced view of “competitive federalism.”

<p id="paper4"> <h3> Religion Versus Nationhood: Organizing Health Care in Argentina and the US  </h3> 

In this project I investigate path dependence effects to explain the organization of healthcare systems in Argentina and the United States. Before the 1940s, private firms and philanthropic societies dominated healthcare in both countries, and the state played a limited role. After the 1940s health insurance spread into the workplace, but the healthcare system of the two countries started to differ from each other. In Argentina, insurance expanded in the form of trade union funds while in the US it was through private pre-paid plans provided by employers. I argue that this difference is explained by the relationship between fraternal societies, religion, and trade unions. In Argentina, fraternal societies, organized around ethnicity, played a major role in providing benefits. These societies were class-based, as ethnic groups tended to be tied to particular employments and eventually turned into unions. In the US, fraternal societies were predominantly organized around religion and had a multi-class membership. These differences help explain the divergent role played by unions and private firms at early stages of healthcare development in each country, respectively.

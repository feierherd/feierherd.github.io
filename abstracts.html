<p id="paper1"> <h3> Bypassing the Gates to the Enemy’s Backyard: Partisan Bias and Land-Titling in Authoritarian Peru </h3> 

Studies of distributive politics that focus only on central-regional or central-local dynamics can produce misleading findings in settings in which there are three levels of government: central, regional, and local. I use a double regression-discontinuity design in local and regional elections in a 2-by-2 factorial design to discern distributive strategies in a three-level competitive authoritarian regime, taking into account the partisanship of mayors as well as of regional office-holders. In a large land-titling program, Peru’s president disproportionally favored municipalities governed by mayors from his own party that were located in regions dominated by other parties. His apparent goal was to undermine the electoral standing of opposition regional governments and minimize the risk that they would interfere with policy implementation or claim credit for it. The strategy met with some success: I show that it yielded an increased vote share for the president’s party.

<p id="paper2"> <h3> Do the Wealthy Oppose Redistribution? Public Price Shocks and Redistributive Preferences in Buenos Aires </h3> 

Are the attitudes of the wealthy toward redistribution shaped mainly by personal income considerations? Or do interpersonal comparisons come into play: are they concerned about how they are treated in comparison with other wealthy people, or with lower-income groups? We take advantage of the Argentine government’s quasi-natural experiment in public price increases to explore the impact of a fiscal shock on the attitudes of wealthy citizens. In addition to studying the impact of the shock per se, we also randomly assign people, on both sides of the natural-experimental border, to framings of the price adjustment that mimicked either the government’s justification for the change – that it was redistributive in favor of low-income rate-payers – or the opposition’s criticism – that the policy created arbitrary differences among wealthy rate-payers. We find that interpersonal comparisons, especially intra-class inequality aversion, was paramount in wealthy porten ̃os’ attitudes toward state-led redistribution.

<p id="paper3"> <h3> A Marathon is Not a Sprint: Business Politics and Tax Exemptions in Brazilian Municipalities  </h3> 

This article examines tax exemptions to businesses in the context of intergovernmental political competition in Brazilian municipalities. The “competitive federalism” tradition argues that competition for mobile sources of revenue leads local governments to a “race to the bottom” in taxation and welfare spending. In this line, studies of Brazil and other countries usually portray local governments engaging on a “fiscal war” to attract investments. I instead argue that parties with different programmatic goals and constituencies differ on the types of investments they wish to attract. I use a regression-discontinuity design in local elections to discern different tax exemption strategies. I find that mayors from different parties are equally likely to grant tax exemptions and other policy benefits to businesses. Yet they differ on the tax instruments they use. Mayors from the center-left Workers’ Party are more likely to waive a tax on services, while mayors from the center-right Social Democratic Party are more likely to waive property taxes. Rather than local governments undercutting one another to attract investments, this article supports a more nuanced view of “competitive federalism.”

<p id="paper4"> <h3> Religion Versus Nationhood: Organizing Health Care in Argentina and the US  </h3> 

In this project I investigate path dependence effects to explain the organization of healthcare systems in Argentina and the United States. Before the 1940s, private firms and philanthropic societies dominated healthcare in both countries, and the state played a limited role. After the 1940s health insurance spread into the workplace, but the healthcare system of the two countries started to differ from each other. In Argentina, insurance expanded in the form of trade union funds while in the US it was through private pre-paid plans provided by employers. I argue that this difference is explained by the relationship between fraternal societies, religion, and trade unions. In Argentina, fraternal societies, organized around ethnicity, played a major role in providing benefits. These societies were class-based, as ethnic groups tended to be tied to particular employments and eventually turned into unions. In the US, fraternal societies were predominantly organized around religion and had a multi-class membership. These differences help explain the divergent role played by unions and private firms at early stages of healthcare development in each country, respectively.
